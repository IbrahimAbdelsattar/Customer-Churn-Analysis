# Banking Churn Analysis & Modeling

## Project Overview
Customer churn poses a significant challenge for banks, leading to financial losses and decreased customer satisfaction. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to predict churn using machine learning models. By identifying key factors influencing churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Problem Statement
Despite continuous efforts by banks to retain customers, churn remains a persistent problem. Understanding the factors that drive customer attrition can help banks develop targeted strategies to improve retention.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer churn behavior using historical banking data.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn probability.
- Identify key features contributing to customer churn.
- Recommend strategies for customer retention based on model insights.
